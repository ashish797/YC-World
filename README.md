# gstack-openclaw

Garry Tan's [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) adapted for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw).

29 opinionated skills that turn your AI agent into a virtual engineering team — CEO, Designer, Eng Manager, Release Manager, Doc Engineer, QA, and Security Officer.

A complete 1:1 port of [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack). Nothing skipped.

## What's different from original gstack

| Original gstack | gstack-openclaw |
|---|---|
| Claude Code slash commands (`/qa`, `/ship`) | OpenClaw SKILL.md skills (triggered by description) |
| Compiled browse binary (headless Chromium) | OpenClaw's built-in browser tool |
| Codex CLI integration | OpenClaw sub-agent spawning |
| `~/.claude/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| `AskUserQuestion` tool | Conversational prompting |
| Claude Code hooks (PreToolUse) | Instruction-based safety rules |
| Telemetry & update checks | None (clean) |

## Install

### Method 1: Chat Command (easiest)

Just tell your OpenClaw agent:

> "install gstack"

That's it. The agent clones the repo, symlinks all skills, builds the browser binary. Non-destructive — never overwrites your existing skills.

Also works: "setup gstack", "get gstack skills", "add gstack for openclaw"

**Update:** "update gstack"
**Uninstall:** "uninstall gstack"

### Method 2: Terminal (technical)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashish797/YC-World/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or clone manually:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ashish797/YC-World.git ~/.agents/skills/gstack-openclaw
cd ~/.agents/skills/gstack-openclaw && bash install.sh
```

**Non-destructive:** never overwrites existing skills. Skips any skill name that already exists in `~/.agents/skills/`.

### Method 3: ClawHub (coming soon)

```bash
clawhub install gstack-openclaw
```

## Uninstall

Chat: "uninstall gstack"
Terminal: `bash ~/.agents/skills/gstack-openclaw/uninstall.sh`

Both remove all symlinks and the repo. Your other skills stay untouched.

## Browser (browse)

The browse skill is a **headless Chromium browser** — fast, persistent session, structured snapshots, diff mode, responsive testing. Compiles to a single binary using Bun + Playwright.

**Auto-built on install** if Bun is available. Requires `CONTAINER=1` in Docker environments.

## Setup & Utilities

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| connect-chrome | Launch real Chrome with Side Panel — watch every action in real time |
| setup-browser-cookies | Import cookies from Chrome/Firefox/Edge for authenticated testing |
| setup-deploy | Configure deployment platform (Vercel, Fly, Render, Heroku, etc.) |
| gstack-upgrade | Self-update to latest version |

MIT — same as [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/blob/main/LICENSE).
